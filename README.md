# E-commerce Platform
This project is a course requirement for the semester, where we create an E-commerce platform. The application is capable of performing CRUD operations on an inventory and a shopping cart.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. If you don't have an IDE that can handle C# projects, you'll need to install one, like Visual Studio.  
3. Open the solution file (.sln) in your IDE.  
4. Build the solution (this should resolve dependencies).  
5. Run the application in your IDE.  

## Features

* Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on two lists of Product objects: Inventory and Cart.
* Basic console application functionality.
* Search inventory or cart by product name or description.
* Display subtotal (excluding taxes), tax amount (7% sales tax), and total amount upon checkout.
* Ability to save the cart, exit the application, and return with the cart state preserved.
* Sub-classification of products into ProductByWeight and ProductByQuantity.
* Displaying products in sorted lists.
* Pagination support in product display.
* Marking items as "buy one, get one" (bogo) from the inventory management menu.
* Checkout process includes entering (fake) payment information and a shipping address.
* Application converted into a thick client or mobile application using WPF, UWP, or Xamarin.Forms.
* Cart saving with user-specified names.
* Server-side implementation for inventory CRUD and cart management.
* Server-side persistence of data state even after restarting the client and server-side solutions.
